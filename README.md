# RockPaperScissors
This simple game requires no explanation. The program is a demo of some basic Java skills along with JUnit testing.
It has been built as a Maven project to set up Project structure professionally.
Please let me know through Teams if there are any issues with the program!
Thanks,
Ansaar :)
